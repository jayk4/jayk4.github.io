Jaesuk Kwon is previously Postdoctoral researcher in Electical and Computer Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin. Most focused research is to develope an commercial ready nano-device with emerging technology. Recent research efforts has emphasized on the machine learning (neural network) tests associated with matrix-vector multiplication and statistical distribution of probablity bits created by magnetic tunnel junction device. Also, deeply looking into the possible usage for spintronics device on neuromorphic computing.
