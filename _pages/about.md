Jaesuk Kwon was previously Postdoctoral researcher in Electical and Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, and affiliated with Microelectronics Research Center (Pickle campus). Most focused research is/was to develope an commercial ready nano-device with emerging technology, spintronics. Recent research efforts has emphasized on the machine learning (neural network) tests associated with matrix-vector multiplication and statistical distribution of probablity bits created by magnetic tunnel junction device. Also, deeply looking into the possible usage for spintronics device on neuromorphic computing.
