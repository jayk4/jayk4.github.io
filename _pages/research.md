Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ)
------
* Non-volatile STT-MRAM has been developed to replace flash memory with respect to long data storage capability (more than 10 years), and fast switching and data writing capability (less than 5ns), which is governed by magnetization dynamics. Advanced nano-technology (<5nm, even at the future's Angstrom process) shows a possibility to replace SRAM (fast data writing memory, 6T cell) and high speed DRAM (compact 1T1C cell) with spintronics non-volatile memory, MRAM (1T1R cell). Also, this device has been investigated and developted on the purpose of drastically reducing energy consumption, comparable to the CMOS intergrated circuits. The performance of data write/retention determined by MTJs - a core component of MRAM - that is able to modulated depending on applications.
Recent, research group developted a new multilayered ferromagnetic structure that can improve the MTJ characteristic switching/relaxation time in ns regime, in structure were successfully fabricated down to 2 nm or less than 1nm in diameter.
As of, the MTJ device widely uses for the applications, automobile industry, space to IoT, and attemp to deploy in AI technology.

THz antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR)
------
* THz is available to detect with insulating AFM, MnF2, CrCl2, and so on.
* Antiferromagnetic resonance has demonstrated by theory & experiment.

Racetrack memory & neuromorphic circuit by domain wall (DW)
------
* DW motion in nano/micro-wires, so called Racetrack memory for real application.
* Magnetic domains in multi-layer, e.g. RKKY structure.
