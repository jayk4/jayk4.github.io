Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ)
------
* Structure, random telegraph noise.

THz antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR)
------
* THz is available to detect with insulating AFM, MnF2, CrCl2, and so on.
* Antiferromagnetic resonance has demonstrated by theory & experiment.

Racetrack memory & neuromorphic circuit by domain wall (DW)
------
* DW motion in nano/micro-wires, so called Racetrack memory for real application.
* Magnetic domains in multi-layer, e.g. RKKY structure.
