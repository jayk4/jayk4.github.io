Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) model
------
* MTJ coded by python.
* MTJ coded by Matlab.
* MTJ coded by Cadence Virtuoso Verilog A. Full CMOS memory circuit such SRAM (6T cell), DRAM (1T1C cell) with peripheral circuit. This will simulate the manage data access, amplification, refreshig for DRAM, timing for memory array, and so on. Peripheral circuit components are Row/Column Decoders, Word/Read Line (WL/RL) line, Multiplexers, Sense Amplifiers, Pre-charge circuitry.
* Spin current density & Joul heating as spin current transport can be simulated by COMSOL and OOMMF ovf file.

MnF2 THz antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) model
------
* Antiferromagnetic simulation coded by Matlab
* This demonstrats spin dynamics with flipflop and THz magnetic resonances associate with two modes.

Domain Wall motion & Skirmion simulators
------
* Skirmion simulation coded by MuMax3 (DW simulation is also available).
* Domain Wall & Skirmion simulation coded by OOMMF.
* Spin current transport via magnetic/metal juction can be studied by COMSOL and OOMMF ovf file.
