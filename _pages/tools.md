Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) model
------
* MTJ coded by python.
* MTJ coded by Matlab.
* MTJ coded by Cadence Virtuoso Verilog A. Full CMOS memory circuit such SRAM (6T cell), DRAM (1T1C cell) with peripheral circuit. This will simulate the manage data access, amplification, refreshig for DRAM, timing for memory array, and so on. Peripheral circuit components are Row/Column Decoders, Word/Read Line (WL/RL) line, Multiplexers, Sense Amplifiers, Pre-charge circuitry.

MnF2 THz antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) model
------
* Antiferromagnetic simulation coded by Matlab
* This demonstrats spin dynamics with flipflop and THz magnetic resonances associate with two modes.
